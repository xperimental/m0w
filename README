READEME for m0w
---------------

Currently m0w is a project for myself to test drive my own test driven development
skills. I thought making an implementation of a popular card game was a good idea
for a project.

Although this project is started as a playground for TDD the aim is that the
game is playable someday.

Please feel free to fork this repository and start your own TDD endeavours.
